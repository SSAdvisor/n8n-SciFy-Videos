# n8n SciFy Videos Workflow Import Instructions

## Overview

This repository contains a complete n8n workflow system for automated SciFy video creation. 
The system includes **3 main workflows** and **29 sub-workflows (modules)** that work together 
to generate, process, schedule, and publish science fiction video content to YouTube in both 
short-form and long-form formats.

**Note:** Some of the names of the files below are related to my environment and may not
be beneficial to you therefore you may not want to import them. Be sure to follow the import 
instructions as the order of import is important. Review each module (especially the foundation
sub-workflows) and modify them if needed to fit your needs.

Video Production → Upload/Management → Webhooks → Main Workflows
```

## How to Import Each Workflow

### Method 1: Via n8n UI (Recommended)
1. Open your n8n instance in your web browser
2. Go to **Workflows** section
3. Click **"Add workflow"** or the **+** button
4. Click **"Import from file"** or **"Import from URL"**
5. Select the JSON file from the repository (or paste the GitHub raw URL)
6. Click **"Import"**
7. **The workflow will appear with the default name "My Workflow"**
8. **Click on the workflow name at the top and rename it** to match the filename (e.g., "WF002 - SciFy Shorts")
9. Save the workflow

**Tips:**
- This is the most reliable method for all deployment types (Docker, npm, etc.)
- Works the same regardless of how n8n is installed
- The workflow name is NOT stored in the JSON file - you must rename it manually
- Use the filename as a guide for what to name the workflow

### Method 2: Copy-Paste JSON
1. Open the JSON file in a text editor or on GitHub
2. Copy the entire JSON content (use "Raw" view on GitHub)
3. In n8n, create a new workflow
4. Click anywhere on the canvas
5. Press **Ctrl+V** (or **Cmd+V** on Mac) to paste
6. The workflow nodes will appear on the canvas
7. **Click on "My Workflow" at the top and rename it** appropriately (use the filename as reference)
8. Save the workflow

**Tips:**
- Useful for quick imports of single workflows
- Good for testing or modifying workflows before saving
- Always rename the workflow to match the intended name
- May require manual credential configuration

**Important Note**: The workflow name is stored in n8n's database, not in the exported JSON file. Both import methods will result in a default name like "My Workflow". You must manually rename each workflow after import to maintain proper organization.

## Credentials Setup

After importing, you'll need to configure credentials for various services.

### Required Credentials

1. **YouTube API (Multiple Accounts)**
   - Type: `Google OAuth2 API`
   - Accounts needed:
     - SciFy-Shorts Account
     - Other credentials per channels
   - Used for: Video uploads, updates, and management
   - Setup: Go to Google Cloud Console, enable YouTube Data API v3
   - Documentation: https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/

2. **Google Drive/Sheets**
   - Type: `Google Service Account` or `Google OAuth2 API`
   - Used for: File storage, spreadsheet operations, and video ledgers
   - Setup: Create service account with Drive and Sheets API access
   - Documentation: https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/

3. **AI/LLM Services (Z2L API)**
   - **API Endpoint**: https://api.zero2launch.com
   - **Type**: HTTP Request with API Key authentication
   - **Models Available**: 
     - `openai-large` (for metadata generation)
     - `roblox-rp` (for script generation)
     - Plus: GPT-4, GPT-5, DeepSeek, Gemini, and more
   - **Used for**: Script generation, story creation, metadata optimization
   - **How to Get API Key**:
     1. Join the Z2L Premium: Builder's Circle community
     2. Visit: https://www.skool.com/z2l-premium-builders-circle-7291/about?ref=a9f6fac834ae4192ad86455a3cee0439
     3. Membership: $49/month (Founding Member pricing - increases to $79/mo)
     4. Benefits: Unlimited use of all AI models (GPT-4, GPT-5, DeepSeek, Gemini, Flux, etc.)
     5. Once joined, obtain your API key from the community resources
   - **Setup in n8n**:
     - Create HTTP Request credential
     - Set Base URL: `https://api.zero2launch.com`
     - Add Header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
     - Or follow specific credential setup provided in the community

4. **Image Generation Service (Flux)**
   - **API Endpoint**: Available through Z2L API (https://api.zero2launch.com)
   - **Models**: Flux, Flux Kontext
   - **Used for**: AI image generation, avatars, thumbnails
   - **Setup**: Use same Z2L API credentials as LLM services
   - Note: Flux image generation is included in Z2L Premium membership

   - **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Voice generation
   - **Whisper**: Speech-to-text transcription
   - **Vision**: Image analysis
   - All included with Z2L Premium membership

### Credential Configuration Steps

1. **After importing workflows**, go to **Credentials** section in n8n
2. **Create new credentials** for each required service
3. **Name them descriptively** for your own reference (e.g., "YouTube", "Z2L API", "Google Drive", "Google Sheets")
4. **After import, manually update each workflow**:
   - Open each imported workflow
   - Look for nodes with red warning indicators (credential errors)
   - Click on each node with an error
   - Select the appropriate credential from the dropdown
   - Save the workflow
5. **Test each credential** to ensure proper connection

**Important**: Credential IDs are instance-specific and don't transfer between n8n installations. You will need to manually map credentials in imported workflows regardless of naming conventions. Having matching or similar names just makes it easier to identify which credential to select from the dropdown.

### Z2L API Configuration Example

For workflows using the Z2L API, you'll typically configure the HTTP Request node like this:

```
Authentication: Generic Credential Type
Credential for HTTP Request:
  - Name: Z2L API
  - Authentication: Header Auth
  - Header Name: Authorization
  - Header Value: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Or if using a predefined credential:
```
Base URL: https://api.zero2launch.com
API Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Refer to the Z2L Premium community documentation for the most up-to-date API configuration instructions.

## Post-Import Configuration

### 1. Update Workflow Controls

Each main workflow has a "Workflow Controls" node. Update these settings:

**WF002 - SciFy Shorts:**
```json
{
  "yt_upload": true,           // Set to false for testing
  "yt_credentials": "YOUR_CREDENTIAL_NAME",
  "yt_privacy": "public",      // or "private" for testing
  "ggl_upload": false,         // Set to true if using Google Drive
  "ggl_credentials": "YOUR_CREDENTIAL_NAME"
}
```

**WF020 - YouTube Scheduler:**
```json
{
  "list": [
    {
      "chan": "HOA_NIGHTMARES",
      "path": "HOA_Nightmares",
      "schd": {"morn": "6:00", "evng": "18:00"}
    },
    // Add other channels as needed
  ]
}
```

**WF021 - SciFy Shorts Expanded 2 Long Form:**
```json
{
  "yt_upload": true,
  "yt_credentials": "YOUTUBE CREDENTIAL IDENTIFIER",
  "yt_privacy": "private",
  "ggl_spreadsheet_path": "/ConnectCircuits/SciFy",
  "ggl_spreadsheet_name": "video_ledger",
  "llm_model": "openai-large",
  "story_word_count": 5000,
  "story_genre": "science fiction"
}
```

### 2. Configure Schedules

**WF002 - SciFy Shorts:**
- Default: Every 6 hours
- Adjust: Modify Schedule Trigger node as needed

**WF020 - YouTube Scheduler:**
- Default: Daily at 8:00 PM
- Adjust: Modify Schedule Trigger node for your preferred time

**WF021 - SciFy Shorts Expanded 2 Long Form:**
- Default: Every 12 hours
- Adjust: Modify Schedule Trigger node as needed

### 3. Update Sub-workflow References

All "Execute Workflow" nodes reference workflows by ID. When importing to a new instance:

1. Open each main workflow
2. Check each "Execute Workflow" node
3. Verify the workflow ID matches your imported sub-workflows
4. Update if necessary (IDs change when importing to different instances)

**Pro Tip:** Use n8n's workflow ID from the URL bar when viewing each workflow

### 4. Test Each Sub-workflow Independently

Before running main workflows:
1. Test each sub-workflow individually with sample data
2. Verify all credentials work properly
3. Check file paths and storage locations
4. Ensure API rate limits are understood

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Workflow not found" errors
**Cause**: Sub-workflow IDs don't match after import  
**Solution**: 
1. Find the correct workflow ID from the URL when viewing the sub-workflow
2. Update the Execute Workflow node with the correct ID
3. Save and test the workflow

### Issue 2: Credential errors
**Cause**: Missing or incorrectly configured credentials  
**Solution**:
1. Create credentials for each required service
2. Open workflows with red error indicators
3. Click each node showing errors
4. Select the appropriate credential from the dropdown
5. Test each credential connection before running workflows

### Issue 3: Import fails or hangs
**Cause**: Large JSON files or complex dependencies  
**Solution**:
1. Import one workflow at a time
2. Refresh browser between imports
3. Check n8n logs for specific errors
4. Ensure sufficient server resources (RAM, disk space)

### Issue 4: Module dependencies not resolved
**Cause**: Sub-workflows imported out of order  
**Solution**:
1. Follow the import order exactly as documented
2. Re-import sub-workflows if needed
3. Verify each phase completes before moving to next

### Issue 5: API rate limits exceeded
**Cause**: Too many API calls in short period  
**Solution**:
1. Add wait/delay nodes between API calls
2. Implement batch processing with appropriate delays
3. Monitor API usage and adjust workflow execution frequency

### Issue 6: File storage issues
**Cause**: Incorrect paths or insufficient permissions  
**Solution**:
1. Verify Google Drive paths exist
2. Check service account permissions
3. Ensure adequate storage space
4. Test file operations with small files first

### Issue 7: Workflows appear with wrong names
**Cause**: Workflow names are not stored in JSON files  
**Solution**:
1. After importing, manually rename each workflow
2. Use the JSON filename as a guide (e.g., "WF002 - SciFy Shorts.json" → "WF002 - SciFy Shorts")
3. Keep consistent naming for easier management
